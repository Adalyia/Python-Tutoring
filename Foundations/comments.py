    Comments are used to document code. They are entirely ignored by the interpreter at runtime
    and are only used to provide additional information about the code.

    There are two types of comments in Python:
    - Single line comments
    - Multi-line comments

    Single line comments are used to document a single line of code.
    They are denoted by a # symbol at the beginning of the line.
    Everything after the # symbol is ignored by the interpreter.

    Multi-line comments are used to document multiple lines of code.
    They are denoted by a triple quote at the beginning of the line and a triple quote at the end of the line.
    Everything between the triple quotes is ignored by the interpreter. For example what you're reading right now.
